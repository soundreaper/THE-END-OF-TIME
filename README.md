THE END OF TIME

The year is 2525 and humans have polluted the Earth to no end and our planet is slowly dying.
Earth is slowly becoming inhospitable and the world government is meeting to find a solution.
What will become of the human race?

This sounds suspiciously like Wall-e.

Coincidence? I think not!
